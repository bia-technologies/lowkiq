## Rationale

We've faced some problems using Sidekiq while processing messages from a side system.
For instance, the message is the data of an order at a particular time.
The side system will send new data of an order on every change.
Orders are frequently updated and a queue contains some closely located messages of the same order.

Sidekiq doesn't guarantee a strict message order, because a queue is processed by multiple threads.
For example, we've received 2 messages: M1 and M2.
Sidekiq handlers begin to process them parallel,
so M2 can be processed before M1.

Parallel processing of such kind of messages can result in:

+ deadlocks
+ overwriting new data with an old one

Lowkiq has been created to eliminate such problems by avoiding parallel task processing within one entity.

## Description

Lowkiq's queues are reliable i.e.,
Lowkiq saves information about a job being processed
and returns uncompleted jobs to the queue on startup.

Jobs in queues are ordered by preassigned execution time, so they are not FIFO queues.

Every job has its identifier. Lowkiq guarantees that jobs with equal IDs are processed by the same thread.

Every queue is divided into a permanent set of shards.
A job is placed into a particular shard based on an id of the job.
So jobs with the same id are always placed into the same shard.
All jobs of the shard are always processed with the same thread.
This guarantees the sequential processing of jobs with the same ids and excludes the possibility of locks.

Besides the id, every job has a payload.
Payloads are accumulated for jobs with the same id.
So all accumulated payloads will be processed together.
It's useful when you need to process only the last message and drop all previous ones.

A worker corresponds to a queue and contains a job processing logic.

The fixed number of threads is used to process all jobs of all queues.
Adding or removing queues or their shards won't affect the number of threads.

## Sidekiq comparison

If Sidekiq is good for your tasks you should use it.
But if you use plugins like
[sidekiq-grouping](https://github.com/gzigzigzeo/sidekiq-grouping),
[sidekiq-unique-jobs](https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs),
[sidekiq-merger](https://github.com/dtaniwaki/sidekiq-merger)
or implement your own lock system, you should look at Lowkiq.

For example, sidekiq-grouping accumulates a batch of jobs then enqueues it and accumulates the next batch.
With this approach, a queue can contain two batches with data of the same order.
These batches are parallel processed with different threads, so we come back to the initial problem.

Lowkiq was designed to avoid any type of locking.

Furthermore, Lowkiq's queues are reliable. Only Sidekiq Pro or plugins can add such functionality.

This [benchmark](examples/benchmark) shows overhead on Redis usage.
These are the results for 5 threads, 100,000 blank jobs:

+ lowkiq: 155 sec or 1.55 ms per job
+ lowkiq +hiredis: 80 sec or 0.80 ms per job
+ sidekiq: 15 sec or 0.15 ms per job

This difference is related to different queues structure.
Sidekiq uses one list for all workers and fetches the job entirely for O(1).
Lowkiq uses several data structures, including sorted sets for keeping ids of jobs.
So fetching only an id of a job takes O(log(N)).

## Queue

Please, look at [the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRdwA2Ck22r26KV1DbY__XcYpj2FdlnR-2G05w1YULErnJLB_JL1itYbBC6_JbLSPOHwJ0nwvnIHH2A/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

Every job has the following attributes:

+ `id` is a job identifier with string type.
+ `payloads` is a sorted set of payloads ordered by its score. A payload is an object. A score is a real number.
+ `perform_in` is planned execution time. It's a Unix timestamp with a real number type.
+ `retry_count` is amount of retries. It's a real number.

For example, `id` can be an identifier of a replicated entity.
`payloads` is a sorted set ordered by a score of payload and resulted by grouping a payload of the job by its `id`.
`payload` can be a ruby object because it is serialized by `Marshal.dump`.
`score` can be `payload`'s creation date (Unix timestamp) or it's an incremental version number.
By default, `score` and `perform_in` are current Unix timestamp.
`retry_count` for new unprocessed job equals to `-1`,
for one-time failed is `0`, so the planned retries are counted, not the performed ones.

Job execution can be unsuccessful. In this case, its `retry_count` is incremented, the new `perform_in` is calculated with determined formula, and it moves back to a queue.

In case of `retry_count` is getting `>=` `max_retry_count` an element of `payloads` with less (oldest) score is moved to a morgue,
rest elements are moved back to the queue, wherein `retry_count` and `perform_in` are reset to `-1` and `now()` respectively.

### Calculation algorithm for `retry_count` and `perform_in`

0. a job's been executed and failed
1. `retry_count++`
2. `perform_in = now + retry_in (try_count)`
3. `if retry_count >= max_retry_count` the job will be moved to a morgue.

| type                      | `retry_count` | `perform_in`          |
| ---                       | ---           | ---                   |
| new haven't been executed | -1            | set or `now()`        |
| new failed                | 0             | `now() + retry_in(0)` |
| retry failed              | 1             | `now() + retry_in(1)` |

If `max_retry_count = 1`, retries stop.

### Job merging rules

They are applied when:

+ a job has been in a queue and a new one with the same id is added
+ a job is failed, but a new one with the same id has been added
+ a job from a morgue is moved back to a queue, but the queue has had a job with the same id

Algorithm:

+ payloads are merged, the minimal score is chosen for equal payloads
+ if a new job and queued job is merged, `perform_in` and `retry_count` is taken from the job from the queue
+ if a failed job and queued job is merged, `perform_in` and `retry_count` is taken from the failed one
+ if morgue job and queued job is merged, `perform_in = now()`, `retry_count = -1`

Example:

```
# v1 is the first version and v2 is the second
# #{"v1": 1} is a sorted set of a single element, the payload is "v1", the score is 1

# a job is in a queue
{ id: "1", payloads: #{"v1": 1, "v2": 2}, retry_count: 0, perform_in: 1536323288 }
# a job which is being added
{ id: "1", payloads: #{"v2": 3, "v3": 4}, retry_count: -1, perform_in: 1536323290 }

# a resulted job in the queue
{ id: "1", payloads: #{"v1": 1, "v2": 3, "v3": 4}, retry_count: 0, perform_in: 1536323288 }
```

A morgue is a part of a queue. Jobs in a morgue are not processed.
A job in a morgue has the following attributes:

+ id is the job identifier
+ payloads

A job from morgue can be moved back to the queue, `retry_count` = 0 and `perform_in = now()` would be set.

## Install

```
# Gemfile

gem 'lowkiq'
```

Redis >= 3.2

## Api

```ruby
module ATestWorker
  extend Lowkiq::Worker

  self.shards_count = 24
  self.batch_size = 10
  self.max_retry_count = 5

  def self.retry_in(count)
    10 * (count + 1) # (i.e. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
  end

  def self.perform(payloads_by_id)
    # payloads_by_id is a hash map
    payloads_by_id.each do |id, payloads|
      # payloads are sorted by score, from old to new (min to max)
      payloads.each do |payload|
        do_some_work(id, payload)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And then you have to add it to Lowkiq in your initializer file due to problems with autoloading:

```ruby
Lowkiq.workers = [ ATestWorker ]
```

Default values:

```ruby
self.shards_count = 5
self.batch_size = 1
self.max_retry_count = 25
self.queue_name = self.name

# i.e. 15, 16, 31, 96, 271, ... seconds + a random amount of time
def retry_in(retry_count)
  (retry_count ** 4) + 15 + (rand(30) * (retry_count + 1))
end
```

```ruby
ATestWorker.perform_async [
  { id: 0 },
  { id: 1, payload: { attr: 'v1' } },
  { id: 2, payload: { attr: 'v1' }, score: Time.now.to_f, perform_in: Time.now.to_f },
]
# payload by default equals to ""
# score and perform_in by default equals to Time.now.to_f
```

It is possible to redefine `perform_async` and calculate `id`, `score` Ð¸ `perform_in` in a worker code:

```ruby
module ATestWorker
  extend Lowkiq::Worker

  def self.perform_async(jobs)
    jobs.each do |job|
      job.merge! id: job[:payload][:id]
    end
    super
  end

  def self.perform(payloads_by_id)
    #...
  end
end

ATestWorker.perform_async 1000.times.map { |id| { payload: {id: id} } }
```

## Ring app

`Lowkiq::Web` - a ring app.

+ `/` - a dashboard
+ `/api/v1/stats` - queue length, morgue length, lag for each worker and total result

## Configuration

Options and their default values are:

+ `Lowkiq.workers = []`- list of workers to use. Since 1.1.0.
+ `Lowkiq.poll_interval = 1` - delay in seconds between queue polling for new jobs.
   Used only if a queue was empty in a previous cycle or an error occurred.
+ `Lowkiq.threads_per_node = 5` - threads per node.
+ `Lowkiq.redis = ->() { Redis.new url: ENV.fetch('REDIS_URL') }` - redis connection options
+ `Lowkiq.client_pool_size = 5` - redis pool size for queueing jobs
+ `Lowkiq.pool_timeout = 5` - client and server redis pool timeout
+ `Lowkiq.server_middlewares = []` - a middleware list, used for worker wrapping
+ `Lowkiq.on_server_init = ->() {}` - a lambda is being executed when server inits
+ `Lowkiq.build_scheduler = ->() { Lowkiq.build_lag_scheduler }` is a scheduler
+ `Lowkiq.build_splitter = ->() { Lowkiq.build_default_splitter }` is a splitter
+ `Lowkiq.last_words = ->(ex) {}` is an exception handler of descendants of `StandardError` caused the process stop
+ `Lowkiq.dump_payload = Marshal.method :dump`
+ `Lowkiq.load_payload = Marshal.method :load`
+ `Lowkiq.format_error_message = :message.to_proc` - option to change the error format for dead jobs. must be a proc.

+ `Lowkiq.format_error = -> (error) { error.message }` can be used to add error backtrace. Please see [Extended error info](#extended-error-info)
+ `Lowkiq.dump_error = -> (msg) { msg }` can be used to implement a custom compression logic for errors. Recommended when using `Lowkiq.format_error`.
+ `Lowkiq.load_error = -> (msg) { msg }` can be used to implement a custom decompression logic for errors.

```ruby
$logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)

Lowkiq.server_middlewares << -> (worker, batch, &block) do
  $logger.info "Started job for #{worker} #{batch}"
  block.call
  $logger.info "Finished job for #{worker} #{batch}"
end

Lowkiq.server_middlewares << -> (worker, batch, &block) do
  begin
    block.call
  rescue => e
    $logger.error "#{e.message} #{worker} #{batch}"
    raise e
  end
end
```

## Performance

Use [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis-rb) for better performance.

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem "hiredis"
```

```ruby
# config

Lowkiq.redis = ->() { Redis.new url: ENV.fetch('REDIS_URL'), driver: :hiredis }
```

## Execution

`lowkiq -r ./path_to_app`

`path_to_app.rb` must load app. [Example](examples/dummy/lib/app.rb).

The lazy loading of worker modules is unacceptable.
For preliminarily loading modules use
`require`
or [`require_dependency`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Dependencies/Loadable.html#method-i-require_dependency)
for Ruby on Rails.

## Shutdown

Send TERM or INT signal to the process (Ctrl-C).
The process will wait for executed jobs to finish.

Note that if a queue is empty, the process sleeps `poll_interval` seconds,
therefore, the process will not stop until the `poll_interval` seconds have passed.

## Debug

To get trace of all threads of an app:

```
kill -TTIN <pid>
cat /tmp/lowkiq_ttin.txt
```

## Development

```
docker-compose run --rm --service-port app bash
bundle
rspec
cd examples/dummy ; bundle exec ../../exe/lowkiq -r ./lib/app.rb

# open localhost:8080
```

```
docker-compose run --rm --service-port frontend bash
npm run dumb
# open localhost:8081

# npm run build
# npm run web-api
```

## Exceptions

`StandardError` thrown by a worker are handled with middleware. Such exceptions don't lead to process stops.

All other exceptions cause the process to stop.
Lowkiq will wait for job execution by other threads.

`StandardError` thrown outside of worker are passed to `Lowkiq.last_words`.
For example, it can happen when Redis connection is lost or when Lowkiq's code has a bug.

## Rails integration

    klass.connection_pool.disconnect!
    config = init_config.merge 'pool' => Lowkiq.threads_per_node
    klass.establish_connection(config)
  end
end
```

Execution: `bundle exec lowkiq -r ./config/environment.rb`


## Splitter

Each worker has several shards:

```
# worker: shard ids
worker A: 0, 1, 2
worker B: 0, 1, 2, 3
worker C: 0
worker D: 0, 1
```

Lowkiq uses a fixed number of threads for job processing, therefore it is necessary to distribute shards between threads.
Splitter does it.

To define a set of shards, which is being processed by a thread, let's move them to one list:

```
A0, A1, A2, B0, B1, B2, B3, C0, D0, D1
```

Default splitter evenly distributes shards by threads of a single node.

If `threads_per_node` is set to 3, the distribution will be:

```
# thread id: shards
t0: A0, B0, B3, D1
t1: A1, B1, C0
t2: A2, B2, D0
```

Besides Default Lowkiq has the ByNode splitter. It allows dividing the load by several processes (nodes).

```
Lowkiq.build_splitter = -> () do
  Lowkiq.build_by_node_splitter(
    ENV.fetch('LOWKIQ_NUMBER_OF_NODES').to_i,
    ENV.fetch('LOWKIQ_NODE_NUMBER').to_i
  )
end
```

So, instead of a single process, you need to execute multiple ones and to set environment variables up:

```
# process 0
LOWKIQ_NUMBER_OF_NODES=2 LOWKIQ_NODE_NUMBER=0 bundle exec lowkiq -r ./lib/app.rb

# process 1
LOWKIQ_NUMBER_OF_NODES=2 LOWKIQ_NODE_NUMBER=1 bundle exec lowkiq -r ./lib/app.rb
```

Summary amount of threads are equal product of `ENV.fetch('LOWKIQ_NUMBER_OF_NODES')` and `Lowkiq.threads_per_node`.

You can also write your own splitter if your app needs an extra distribution of shards between threads or nodes.

## Scheduler

Every thread processes a set of shards. The scheduler selects shard for processing.
Every thread has its own instance of the scheduler.

Lowkiq has 2 schedulers for your choice.
`Seq` sequentially looks over shards.
`Lag`  chooses shard with the oldest job minimizing the lag. It's used by default.

The scheduler can be set up through settings:

```
Lowkiq.build_scheduler = ->() { Lowkiq.build_seq_scheduler }
# or
Lowkiq.build_scheduler = ->() { Lowkiq.build_lag_scheduler }
```

## Recommendations on configuration

### `SomeWorker.shards_count`

Sum of `shards_count` of all workers shouldn't be less than `Lowkiq.threads_per_node`
otherwise, threads will stay idle.

Sum of `shards_count` of all workers can be equal to `Lowkiq.threads_per_node`.
In this case, a thread processes a single shard. This makes sense only with a uniform queue load.

Sum of `shards_count` of all workers can be more than `Lowkiq.threads_per_node`.
In this case, `shards_count` can be counted as a priority.
The larger it is, the more often the tasks of this queue will be processed.

There is no reason to set `shards_count` of one worker more than `Lowkiq.threads_per_node`,
because every thread will handle more than one shard from this queue, so it increases the overhead.

### `SomeWorker.max_retry_count`

From `retry_in` and `max_retry_count`, you can calculate the approximate time that a payload of a job will be in a queue.
After `max_retry_count` is reached a payload with a minimal score will be moved to a morgue.

For default `retry_in` we receive the following table.

```ruby
def retry_in(retry_count)
  (retry_count ** 4) + 15 + (rand(30) * (retry_count + 1))
end
```

| `max_retry_count` | amount of days of job's life |
| ---               | ---                          |
| 14                | 1                            |
| 16                | 2                            |
| 18                | 3                            |
| 19                | 5                            |
| 20                | 6                            |
| 21                | 8                            |
| 22                | 10                           |
| 23                | 13                           |
| 24                | 16                           |
| 25                | 20                           |

`(0...25).map{ |c| retry_in c }.sum / 60 / 60 / 24`


## Changing of worker's shards amount

Try to count the number of shards right away and don't change it in the future.

If you can disable adding of new jobs, wait for queues to get empty, and deploy the new version of code with a changed amount of shards.

If you can't do it, follow the next steps:

A worker example:

```ruby
module ATestWorker
  extend Lowkiq::Worker

  self.shards_count = 5

  def self.perform(payloads_by_id)
    some_code
  end
end
```

Set the number of shards and the new queue name:

```ruby
module ATestWorker
  extend Lowkiq::Worker

  self.shards_count = 10
  self.queue_name = "#{self.name}_V2"

  def self.perform(payloads_by_id)
    some_code
  end
end
```

Add a worker moving jobs from the old queue to the new one:

```ruby
module ATestMigrationWorker
  extend Lowkiq::Worker

  self.shards_count = 5
  self.queue_name = "ATestWorker"

  def self.perform(payloads_by_id)
    jobs = payloads_by_id.each_with_object([]) do |(id, payloads), acc|
      payloads.each do |payload|
        acc << { id: id, payload: payload }
      end
    end

    ATestWorker.perform_async jobs
  end
end
```

## Extended error info
For failed jobs, lowkiq only stores `error.message` by default. This can be configured by using `Lowkiq.format_error` setting.
`Lowkiq.dump` and `Lowkiq.load_error` can be used to compress and decompress the error messages respectively.
Example:
```ruby
Lowkiq.format_error = -> (error) { error.full_message(highlight: false) }

Lowkiq.dump_error = Proc.new do |msg|
  compressed = Zlib::Deflate.deflate(msg.to_s)
  Base64.encode64(compressed)
end

Lowkiq.load_error = Proc.new do |input|
  decoded = Base64.decode64(input)
  Zlib::Inflate.inflate(decoded)
rescue
  input
end
```
